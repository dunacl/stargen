StarGen is a a random solar system generator, derived from the work of a
great number of people over the past three dozen years. (See Credits.txt for
details.) It's called StarGen because there are already enough versions that
call themselves starform to be confusing. StarGen's preferred output format
its Web pages.

I've taken and updated Stargen:

- Added Star classification: class, color and temperature
- Added an option to export data in JSON format using jWrite
